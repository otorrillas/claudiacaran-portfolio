        <h2>Introduction.</h2>
        <p>The Typeform community enjoys having lots of impact with little effort. And with our latest design options, including layouts, this was a piece of cake. But the project of announcing these features to the world wasn’t.
        People who use design in their typeforms create better experiences for their audiences. This means they get more value from our products and tend to stick around longer as customers. Great, because our users have free access to thousands of professional photos. And one million icons, two clicks away. But here’s the issue—most of our users have no idea.
        So, for the benefit of humanity, a project brief was born. It went something like this: please get more users and new signups to try these design features.</p>

        <h2>Concept.</h2>
        <p>We created a 360 marketing campaign centered around an innovative landing page. The criteria for all assets were to use lots of visuals with minimal text, and to demonstrate the features in action wherever possible. 
        Part of the assignment was to make this landing page a ‘homepage takeover’ for a few weeks. This is quite a pickle from a design and content perspective, because people visit the homepage for different reasons. How do you announce news to veterans, while pitching the product from square one to curious newcomers? Show, don’t tell.
        For that, I decided to recreated the product on parts of the page and develop an interactive page that communicates the beauty of Typeform. That way, existing users could experience the news, and non-users could learn what we were in the flesh, so to speak, without explanation.

        <h2>Art Directon.</h2>
        <p>The focus of this campaign was to spread emotion, movement, and life through the assets that would be presented in the page. 
        Typeform brand is known to always put people first, so we didn't want to leave this proposition aside but to encourage even more our users to be themselves by expressing who they are and for what they stand for; whether it's by using images, videos or  icons.
        The messaging, “Goodbye forms. Hello typeforms.” was broad enough to imply innovation, and relevant enough to hint at product updates. </p>

        <p>One. We decided to bundle Unsplash and Pexels together, using the messaging “Bring your questions to life”, and nature-themed imagery.
        Two. Icons have a unique way of making complex things simple. To play on this, we turned the noun “icon” into an adjective with the messaging “Look iconic”.
        Three. Layouts, the hero feature, lets you be more you through customization. We called it “Make it yours”, and showcased the four different layout options.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion.</h2>
        <p>Whenever a short timeline meets a long to-do list, some chaos is bound to happen. Compromises have to be made, and nails will be chewed on. But that’s business. 
        But ultimately, we pulled through with solid collaboration and fast decision making, and hit the deadline. Our collective healthy mix of feelings on the project are perhaps best summarized in Georgina’s own words. Here’s her response to a question of her overall impression: “Excited and exhausted at the same time”.
